### 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

#### Idea
For this one, the idea is we first check the right pointer to see if we
have already put the element into the hash table. If we have already put
the element into the hashtable, we should increase the left pointer until
the sliding window satisfies the condition.


Time complexity:
Although it has a while loop, the element in the while loop shows up at
most once, so the time complexity is O(n) + O(n) = O(n)
