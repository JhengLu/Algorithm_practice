### 15. 3Sum
For this problem, we still use the two pointers.
A lot of techniques I have learned by solving this problem:

(1) 
This one will sort the vector in the ascending order;
```c++
sort(nums.begin(), nums.end())
```

(2)
We need to consider the corner case
```c++
if (nums[i] > 0){
    return ans;
}
```

(3)
We need to remove the duplication:

We also need to pay attention to the `i > 0`, which is important

```c++
if (i > 0 && nums[i] == nums[i-1]){
    continue;
}
```

This is also important:
```c++
while (right > left && nums[right] == nums[right - 1]) right--;
while (right > left && nums[left] == nums[left + 1]) left++;
```

(4)
Finally do not forget to move the left and right pointer
