### 844. Backspace String Compare
We use two pointers: slowPointer and fastPointer.
The slowPointer stores effective characters, while the fastPointer explores the next potential character.
If fastPointer encounters #, it moves to the next character, and slowPointer moves back to the previous one.
Otherwise, slowPointer stores the current character from fastPointer.
