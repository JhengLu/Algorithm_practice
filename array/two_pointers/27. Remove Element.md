This problem requires us to use the fast pointer and slow pointer.
Here are several things you need to pay attention to:

(1) the return value is slowPointer, rather than slowPointer + 1;

(2) You need to compare the value to nums[fastPointer]. 
Imagine the fastPointer first jumping to the next slot of the target element, 
then the slowPointer moves to the slot that will be covered by the element the fastPointer is currently pointing to.
