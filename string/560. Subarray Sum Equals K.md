### 560. Subarray Sum Equals K

#### Idea
Here, we utilize the prefix sum and use an unordered_map to store it.
If `prefix_sum - target_value` exists in the map, that means there are previous occurrences of `prefix_sum - target_value`,
which serve as starting points that could lead to the target value, with the current position as the ending point.



### Technique
```c++
mp.find(pre - k) != mp.end()

mp[pre] ++; // directly update the map value
```
