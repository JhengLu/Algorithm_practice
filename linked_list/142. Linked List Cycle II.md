### 142. Linked List Cycle II


#### Solution
For this problem, we need some math.
Assuming before the loop, we have a nodes, and the loop has b nodes.
When the fast pointer and slow pointer meet each other, fast pointer should have already 
gone through s + nb nodes.



f = s + nb
f = 2s

->
s = nb

So the slow pointer needs to move a steps, since the start point is at a + nb.

Then we could move the fast node back to the head, and then move them together.
