### 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists
Solution:
Assume they have the intersection, and after the intersection there are c nodes;
So A will go through a + c + b nodes
B will go through b + c + a nodes
Then they will meet each other.

Technique:
```c++
A = A != nullptr? A->next : headB;

ListNode * A = headA, *B = headB; 
// here the B also needs the star, so the best way is the following:
ListNode *A = headA;
ListNode *B = headB; 
```
