### 148. Sort List

Since the time requirement is `nlogn`, we choose to use merge sort.
Here, one thing we need to pay attention is that
The idea is that we divide the sequence into two parts, and then compare each part;


```c++
fast = head -> next;
slow = head;
```

It is because we want the `slow` to move `(total_node - 1) / 2`
However, if we use `fast = head`, it will move `(total_node - 1) / 2 + 1`
