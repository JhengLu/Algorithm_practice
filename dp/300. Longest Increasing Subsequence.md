### 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence
#### Solution
The most important is to write the state transition function.
Here it does not request the subsequence to be continuous, 
so we only need to consider if current one is larger.

Then we use two loops to check the value
`dp[i] = max(dp[j]+1, dp[i])`

#### Technique

Initialization
`vector<int>dp(n,0)`

Get the max value
`*max_element(dp.begin(), dp.end())`
